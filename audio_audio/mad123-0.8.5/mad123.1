.Sh NAME
.Nm mad123
.Nd play MPEG audio files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl cq
.Op Fl b Ar size
.Op Fl f Ar device
.Op Fl p Ar playlistfile
.Op Ar file ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a command line MPEG audio files player using Robert Leslie's
.Dq libmad
fixed-point MP3 decoder library.
.Nm
is not meant to be a serious replacement for the ubiquitous
.Xr mpg123 1
program.
Instead, it is merely an experiment in using libmad.
.Pp
At the time
.Nm
was written, a couple of things set it apart from the command line player
supplied with libmad,
.Xr madplay 1 :
.Pp
.Bl -dash -offset indent
.It
Support for URL style pathnames.
.It
The audio output is double-buffered (currently about 10 seconds worth
at 44100Hz sample rate).
This means
.Nm
is much less susceptible to network/CPU loading compared to
.Xr madplay 1 .
.It
An intelligent `read-ahead' algorithm can be used to pre-buffer large
chunks of the input MPEG audio stream.
.It
Simple keyboard controls.
.It
Ctrl-C behaves like it does for
.Xr mpg123 1 .
.It
.Nm
can be installed setuid-root (don't worry, it drops privs very early on) so
that it can adjust the scheduling priorities of its two (sometimes three)
processes to be even less susceptible to jitter.
(The third process is used when the MP3 stream is being read from
an URL).
.El
.Sh OPTIONS
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -offset indent
.It Fl b Ar size
Allocate a
.Ar size
bytes buffer which will be used to read-ahead large chunks of the
.Ar file
at a time.
The
.Ar file
will be played even when only a small amount of data has been read in, but
when the buffer fills, no more data will be read until the buffer has
drained to 'nearly' empty.
This behaviour is useful when playing files over a congested network or
when you'd like to spin down a laptop drive for as long as possible.
.It Fl c
Enable keyboard controls.  Currently, the following keys are recognised:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width 4n -offset indent -compact
.It Ic n
Skip to the next track.
.It Ic b
Skip to the previous track.
.It Ic r
Rewind to the start of the current track.
.It Ic p
Pause.
.It Ic q
Quit.
.El
.It Fl f Ar device
Set the audio device to be
.Ar device .
The default is
.Pa /dev/sound .
You can also specify which of the supported audio backends to use by
pre-pending the device with its name followed by a colon.
For example:
.Pa sun:/dev/sound
selects the default Sun-compatible backend, and
.Pa pcm:foo.raw
write raw PCM samples to the file named
.Pa foo.raw .
.Pa pcm:-
causes raw PCM samples to be written to standard output.
.Pp
In addition to the Sun backend,
.Nm
also supports an Analog Real-Time Synthesizer (aRts) backend.
This is particularly useful when running
.Nm
under KDE3, for example.
To use the aRts backend, use the following audio device:
.Pa arts:mad123 .
The text following the colon is passed directly to aRts, and will
show up in aRts Control's Audio Manager status display.
Note: support for aRts is experimental, and is not compiled in by default.
.It Fl p Ar playlistfile
Use the contents of
.Ar playlistfile
to specify the list of mp3 files to be played.
Mp3 files specified on the command line are ignored if this option is present.
.It Fl q
Be quiet.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Play all MP3 files from the current directory, enable keyboard controls and
set the read-ahead buffer to 2 MB:
.Pp
.Dl "mad123 -c -b 0x200000 *.mp3"
.Pp
Play an MP3 stream from an URL, set the read-ahead buffer to 512 kB, be quiet:
.Pp
.Dl "mad123 -q -b 0x80000 http://a.server/mp3s/thrash.mp3"
.Sh NOTES
A read-ahead buffer smaller than 100 kB is ineffective.
.Pp
Using the aRts backend renders the PCM output buffer more or less redundant,
So don't expect perfect jitter-free playback.

.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
program was written by
.An Steve Woodford Aq mad123@mctavish.co.uk .

.An Lubomir Sedlacik Aq salo@NetBSD.org .
.Sh BUGS
There are very few command line options.
.br
Many more buffer parameters should be tweakable on the command line.

Only the Artist and Title ID3 tags are shown, if available.
